          <p>
            I am an epicodus student aspiring to become a professional developer, bright-eyed and bushy tailed to the field of programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from Whitman College in 2014, and have spent all my summers since working on wildland fire crews in Colorado and Oregon. Wildland firefighting is seasonal work, so I spent my winters travelling, skiing, backpacking, and trying to teach myself skills that would provide more consistent employment than just being good with a chainsaw and shovel. I stumbled across coding, and taught myself a bit of python before deciding that programming was a field I would enjoy pursuing further.
          </p>
          <ol><span class="req-other">Some of my favorite things, in no particular order:</span>
            <li>Outdoor endeavors</li>
            <li>Literary pursuits</li>
            <li>Biking through traffic</li>
            <li>Games of all sorts</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I'm incredibly excited for Epicodus and so far have been blown away by the pace of learning and retention through the program.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an epicodus student aspiring to become a professional developer, new enough to the field of programming that most things hold fresh magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from Whitman College in 2014, and have spent all my summers since working on wildland fire crews in Colorado and Oregon. Wildland firefighting is seasonal work, so I spent my winters travelling, skiing, backpacking, and trying to teach myself skills that would provide more consistent employment than just being good with a chainsaw and shovel. I stumbled across coding, and taught myself a bit of python before deciding that programming was a field I would enjoy pursuing further.
      </p>
      <ol>Some of my favorite things, in no particular order:
        <li>Outdoor endeavors</li>
        <li>Literary pursuits</li>
        <li>Biking through traffic</li>
        <li>Games of all sorts</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I'm incredibly excited for Epicodus and so far have been blown away by the pace of learning and retention through the program.
